Description: Small functions to make working with survey data in the context of
    a Net Promoter programme easier. Specifically, data transformation methods,
    some methods for examining the statistical properties of the NPS, such as
    its variance and standard errors, and some simple inferential testing
    procedures. Net Promoter and NPS are registered trademarks of Bain &
